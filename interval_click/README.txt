A macOS tool that will periodically click the mouse at a fixed location, to acknowledge dialogs or prevent applications stalling.

**How to use it**

Run interval_click.command to see where the mouse is. Kill the application by pressing Ctrl + C in the termial window or by closing the terminal window. Open interval_click.command in a text editor to change the numbers "x_val" and "y_val" to move the mouse to the desired location.

When the location is correct, change the number "t_val" to be the number of seconds between clicks (and before the first click).

Then use the program by double clicking interval_click.command. Kill the loop by pressing Ctrl + C in the terminal window or by closing the terminal window.
